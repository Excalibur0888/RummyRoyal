                    <h2>Game of Skill</h2>
                    <p>Rummy is recognized by the Supreme Court of India as a game of skill and is legal to play in most parts of India. The outcome of the game depends on the player's familiarity with the game and their expertise in playing it skillfully.</p>
                    <p>While RummyRoyal provides a platform for playing rummy, the success in the game depends entirely on the player's skill level and not on chance. Players should understand that winning is not guaranteed and depends on their ability to play the game strategically.</p>

                    <p>Playing rummy on RummyRoyal involves financial risk. Players should only play with amounts they can afford to lose. We encourage responsible gaming and provide tools to help players manage their gaming habits.</p>
                    <p>RummyRoyal is not responsible for any financial losses incurred while playing on our platform. Players are advised to set limits on their deposits and playing time to ensure responsible gaming.</p>

                    <p>In the event of a technical issue during gameplay, RummyRoyal will make a fair determination regarding the outcome of the game. This may include voiding the game and refunding the entry fee, or allowing the game to continue from where it was interrupted.</p>
